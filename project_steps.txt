1. Create GitHub repo
2. Create a folder(mlproject) where we will code.Copy path of the folder
3. Open anaconda prompt and paste specific path   ->cd D:\mlproject
4. type ->code .  by doing this vs code instance is created an vs is opened
5. open a new terminal and create a new environment by 
      -> conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y
6. activate the environment 
      ->conda activate venv/
7. sink the project with the github by running the following:
    1. ->git init
    2. create a README.md file and save it  ->git add README.md
    3. ->git commit -m "first commit"

7. to update in vs type ->git pull   

9. create 2 files setup.py(it will create our ML app as a package) and requirements.txt    
10. write code in setup.py    
11. create an src folder and in that create an __init__ file(Main project will be created here)
12. write all the requirements or packages in requirements.py at the end of all requirements type -e . this will directly link it to setup.py 
13. ->pip install -r requirements.txt
